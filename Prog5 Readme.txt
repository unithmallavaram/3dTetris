Power Ups:
1. When you clear multiple rows at once, the timer runs slower than that of the lowest level, until the next tetromino loads.
2. When you level up from 2 to 3, you can choose the next tetromino by entering the corresponding number(see the tetrominoes section for the numbers). This is a once-in-a-game power up.


Scoring:
For every row cleared, the score increases by 10.
As the score increases, levels also increase linearly.
